        <h1>24</h1>
        <p>You land gently on the grass in Golden Gate Park, and make your way home. When you arrive, you see two missed calls on your phone.</p>
        <p>They're from Andrew and Hannah! They explain that Andrew also fell out of the blimp but he landed in the bay and he's okay, while Hannah never got kidnapped in the first place because they got her address wrong. The episode is back on!</p>
        <p class="good-end">You settle in for a rousing conversation about Joan D. Vinge's 1985 novelization of the movie <i>Ladyhawke</i>, comforted by the knowledge that even though the world still has its problems, it's a little bit of a better place now that Jeff Bezos got killed in a fiery zeppelin crash.</p>
        <p class="good-end">The podcast is safe. The end.</p>
