        <h1>17</h1>
        <p>You identify Boris as the weak link in the trio and tackle him. You're rassling on the ground for a couple seconds but then Mayday lifts you up with superhuman strength and holds you for Zao to start punching over and over again.</p>
        <p>"Looks like you won't be dying another day at all," says Zao</p>
        <p>"Looks like the only view you'll be seeing is a view to a kill," says Mayday</p>
        <p>"I am invincible!" says Boris</p>
        <p>Zao cranks back his fist one more time, and with monstrous android strength he plunges it into your chest. A fountain of blood sprays the mechanical trio as a cold steel fist rips your heart out of your body. You watch it give a few last meager beats before he lobs it overboard like a softball.</p>
        <p class="bad-end">Looks like Zao made sure you leave your heart in San Francisco.</p>
