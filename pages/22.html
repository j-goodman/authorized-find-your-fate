        <h1>22</h1>
        <p>You dash up the stairs, catching Bezos and his robots off guard. But once you're halfway up, you hear a beep and suddenly the stairs retract into a smooth ramp. It's just like in the film <i>A View to a Kill</i> from 1985!</p>
        <p class="bad-end">And indeed just like in the film, the slide leads straight to a trapdoor that dumps you unceremoniously onto the tree-lined streets far below. Bezos has killed you. And he didn't even have a license to do that.</p>
