        <h1>18</h1>
        <p class="form-input">You make a dash for the door. The three robot henchman rush to stop you, but all three of their heads bonk together and they stagger backwards, momentarily stunned.</p>
        <p class="form-input">You rush back down the stairs to the hangar bay and look around. The sun is setting outside, and the wind is howling into the open hangar. There's some whaling equipment and navigational controls hanging on one wall. Near the other there's a laptop hooked up to some whirring and blinking machinery, and you rush over to see if there's anything you can do to stop Bezos's plot.</p>
        <p class="form-input">The screen lights up and you see a countdown clock -- only 10 seconds until the deepfake episode of the Authorized Novelizations Podcast goes live! You try to cancel but a prompt pops up telling you to enter Andrew Overbye's email and password in order to proceed.</p>
        <p class="form-input">Looks like your only choice is to give it your best guess.</p>
        <label class="form-input" for="email">Email:</label>
        <input class="form-input" id="email" name="email">
        <br class="form-input" >
        <label class="form-input" for="password">Password:</label>
        <input class="form-input" id="password" name="password">
        <br class="form-input" >
        <button class="form-input" id="submit">Submit</button>
        <p class="success-reveal invisible">It worked! You click the cancel button just as the countdown ticks to 1! You stopped the episode from being published!</p>
        <p class="failure-reveal invisible">It didn't work! You must have guessed wrong. The countdown clock ticks down to zero and the episode publishes.</p>
