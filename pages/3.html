        <p>"Hello?"</p>
        <p>It's Andrew Overbye! You start to explain your situation but he cuts you off:</p>
        <p>"I'm actually not there either, I'm in kind of a crazy situation right now! Just email me your audio when you're done though, it's andrew.do.overbye@gmail.com! I'll explain more when--"</p>
        <p>But before he can explain more, you hear a shuddering sound, then a crack and the lurch of an elevator and a panicked yelp, and the line goes dead. You're not sure what happened. As you put down your phone and turn to look out the window, you see a shocking sight.</p>
