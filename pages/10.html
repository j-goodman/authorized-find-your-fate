        <h1>10</h1>
        <p>You step into the elevator and press the 2 button. As the doors close you notice a note taped to the inside:</p>
        <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Overbye," it says, "I knew for a certainty you'd choose the elevator, after your brief dalliance with the trade of elevator repair. I think you'll find this elevator requires expert attention."</p>
        <p class="bad-end">You hear a shuddering sound, then a crack as the elevator lurches downward. When it hits the bottom, the trapdoor floor swings open and you fall out towards the Golden Gate Bridge below. This trick may not have been meant for you, but it looks like you... fell for it.</p>
