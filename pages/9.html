        <h1>9</h1>
        <p>You scramble to dial 911, but the mystery ninja is too quick for you. With the speed and grace of a jaguar, she knocks the phone from your hand with a high kick.</p>
        <p>"Trying to call for help? Classic novelizations fan, never fighting your own battles. I bet you couldn't even write a novel without a screenplay to help you. Maybe I'll just tell my boss the only way I could stop you from calling the cops was to shut you up... permanently!"</p>
        <p>Before you have time to react, she's grabbed a whaling harpoon from somewhere in the hangar bay. This must be an old decommissioned whaling zeppelin.</p>
        <p class="bad-end">The harpoon plunges through your chest and you stagger backward, feeling the wind in your hair before you fall backwards into the open sky. You may not be a whale, but you just became the catch of the day.</p>
